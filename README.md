# Credimi-Competition

This was a part of a university challenge hosted by Credimi, an italian start-up that lends money to small-medium sized enterprises.

The goal was to predict - assuming that money had been lent to the SME - whether that company would be profitable in the long-term.

The approach adopted for this challenge:

1. Understand the data - what does it represent and how may it be used to solve the challenge
2. Data Cleaning - rectify any missing data
3. Is any feature engineering requried? Establish imputer pipelines where required.
4. Model Selection, Creation and Evaluation
5. Hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance - Grid Search CV and Randomized Search CV
6. Further evaluation of results

The competition was evaluated based on model performance and the approach to the problem, cleanliness of code/notebook structure.
